Today I started working on my betting app again after a short break.

I wanted to render all football fixtures for a specific round.

First I needed to know which rounds were available and so I learned how to use distinct in mongo and mongoose.

I then discovered how to use the this keyword in handlebars to display the rounds on the dashboard

I then created a route in my node app which accepts the round.

Theere's still a lot to be done.

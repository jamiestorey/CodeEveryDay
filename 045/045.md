Today I have been working on my betting app. I needed to be able to get fixtures based from different leagues but it wasn't possible with my old database setup.
Premier League and League One were both in seperate collections and I only had one schema in mongoose.

I had to update my Azure function that gets the foxtires from an api and saves them to the database.

Commits for betting app today:

I was also trying to set up signing my commits with gpg in wsl but couldn't get it working.
I was only prompted for my password once but only a few charachters were shown as asteriks and the rest plain text.

The password was incorrect and I was never able to get that prompt again and instead the command would just hang forever.

I've been thinking of how many tasks there are to complete for the betting app. I should really write them down.

Yesterday I solved a MySQL database problem and today I solved a MongoDB problem. It feels like I'm finally starting to improve ðŸ˜€

If I wasn't able to solve the Mongo problem I would have switched to using a MySQL database for my betting site.

The commit for the issue I fixed:  
https://github.com/jamiestorey/BroccoliBet.NodeApp/pull/15/commits/1749bb10c1af70e3cf3630e34578daf6b3f2eeee

In order to come up with the solution I had to read more documentation and practice with testing projects.

Edit: 6th March 2022 - I've made it better now, the commented out code is from yesterday
https://github.com/jamiestorey/pythoninsertmysql/blob/master/insert-into-database.ipynb

Still trying to insert all my fixtures into a MySQL database. I've figured out how to insert one row.

It's a lot of code though and it looks hideous ðŸ˜›
I'm happy I'm still trying to complete this project rather than giving up ðŸ™‚
I've been working on this since Deceber 30th 2021 and first talked about it on day 30 of my daily diary:

Found some old projects I worked on in my Azure DevOps workspace. I added them to Github and realised I had files included that should have been ignored.

I had added them to the ignorefile but didn't know ow to remove them after they'd already been commited. And so I found the answer on stackoverflow.

The PowerShell script from stackoverflow:

```Powershell
git ls-files -i -c --exclude-from=.gitignore | %{git rm --cached $_}
```

The projects:  
https://github.com/jamiestorey/MeLearningMVC  
https://github.com/jamiestorey/AwesomePetGame  
https://github.com/jamiestorey/ChickenRacer

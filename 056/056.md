I've been trying to close an Issue on my betting website but I'm struggling.  
https://github.com/jamiestorey/BroccoliBet.NodeApp/issues/6

I explained more in my daily blog post:  
https://jamiestorey.dev/development-diary/day-087/

The small amount of python for today:  
https://github.com/jamiestorey/BroccoliBet.Functions.Azure.DailyAPI/commit/140ca2153029b0c273c4338d382963359d4865dd

I've been spening an hour with JavaScript on my betting website but I'm not making any progress.

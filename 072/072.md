Spent a long time trying to chanage my function for my betting site. I wanted to insert all football fixtures into the database with only one insert many call.

Previously I used 2 calls. One call for each league.

I joined to lists together and inserted the whole list into the database.

Now I've made my code even messier than before but had fun.

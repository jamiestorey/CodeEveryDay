# CodeEveryDay
~~Coding each and every day from January 1st 2017~~

I only managed one full month. It felt like a chore having to come up with something every day.

I'm going to restart in 2022 starting from where I ended in 2017 which was the 5th February.

Now instead of trying to make a new project every day. I may just add one new line to a project or write a unit test.
I'll also be going back to the previous days and adding readme files and see if I can imporve or use anything I've previously created in my current projects.

I also have a list of things I'd like to try before December 31st 2022.

## My Goals:
- [ ] Add a read me for each day
- [ ] Create a new code every day website
- [ ] Learn Docker
- [ ] Complete [My Bet Website](https://github.com/jamiestorey/BroccoliBet.NodeApp/)
- [ ] Create a pet game website

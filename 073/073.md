Annoying day. I was going to add a CSS framework to my betting website and so removed the old one but it was still showing up.
I was sure I removed all references to it and cleared my cache.
I thought I had checked every file but it turned out I did miss one.  
Whoops

I only found it after using chrome dev tools to find the url and then searched for the url in my code editor. I should have figured that out sooner.

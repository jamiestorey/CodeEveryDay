Today I was working on my Azure function that my betting app uses to get data from an api
and saves it to mongo db

I've made the repo public now
https://github.com/jamiestorey/azure-time-trigger-function-daily_football_api/tree/master/dailyFootballAPIAllFixtures

It used to also save to a mysql database but...
I also discovered that my mysql database in azure is gone. I noticed when I tried running the function locally
that it couldn't connect and raised an exception.

My function has been running daily in azure and still works though. 

I'm confused 🤷‍♀️🙃

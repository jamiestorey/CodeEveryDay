I've always wanted to create a website with ASP.NET and I always start tutorials and never finish them.

This is a tutorial I will finish and create my own project afterwards.

I know I will this time because I'm writing about it.

Here is the link for my version of the project.
https://github.com/jamiestorey/BlazorTutorialProject  

I didn't know if I should be using Blazor in 2022 or use a Razor project instead.

Doing a local job search showed that more job listings include Razor rather than Blazor.
